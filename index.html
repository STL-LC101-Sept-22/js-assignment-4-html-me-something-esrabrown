      <p class="center">In 2019, I decided to take a solo trip to Jamaica. I used <b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CouchSurfing" 
         target="_blank">Couchsurfing</a></b> when I was traveling in Spain and I wanted to use it in Jamaica for a week. 
          I was lucky that I found an amazing host who helped me a lot. They took care of my documents such of my 
          passport and some money, they gave me their backpack to take a bus to visit another city for few days because
          it is not safe to carry important stuff. When I was outside walking, bunch of people was walking with me, 
          asking me questions and staring at me. To be honest I was a bit scared. But I can clearly say that Jamaican 
          people love helping.  I made it safe and enjoyed a lot, made some friends that I still talk. I never forget my 
          Jamaica trip and looking forward to visit my friends over there.</p>
