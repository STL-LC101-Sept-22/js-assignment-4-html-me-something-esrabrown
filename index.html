         target="_blank">Couchsurfing</a></b> for a week. I was lucky that I found an amazing host who helped me a lot in Kingston.
         Then, I took a bus to visit the beautiful city Ocho Rios which is 2 hours from Kingston.</i></p>

      I explored all the ares that the Ocho Rios region had to offer. Each time I became more and more spiritually connected to a 
      place I had never visited before. Ocho Rios is Spanish name, which translates to “Eight Rivers.”</i></p>

         Bob Marley's museum. I did not have internet during my trip, so having someone I could trust and rely on for information and direction helped make my trip safe and enjoyable.</i></p>
